# New path for mock EHR portal


WE are going to put a mock web portal on a new path called /new-portal. This portal will simulate the experience of accessing electronic health records (EHR) for testing and demonstration purposes.

SCreen shots are attached and we should mimic the layout and functionality as closely as possible. HTML is also included in this folder to mock. The paths do not change so even if we use NextJS we will have to mimick what a HTMP php or JS app would look like. APIs can be normal for search and submision etc. 

We really only need the chart lookup and My Triage build out for now. Chart look up will have a patient search and we will add in static mock data but have it delay slightly to be realistic as we will be automatiting this for testing with playright. Try to mock selectors as closely as you can.
